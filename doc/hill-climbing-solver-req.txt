class hill climbing solver

Implements a hill climbimg algorithm to solve a given cryptogram problem

Requirements:

1. The hill climber takes a cryptogram problem and gets an initial solution
  from it.
2. The hill climber will enter a loop where it will copy the current solution
  and creates a bunch of other solutions that are mutated. Then the best
  solution that is better or equal to the current solution now becomes the
  new current solution and loop continues to the next iteration.
3. If
