class hill climbing solver

Implements a hill climbimg algorithm to solve a given cryptogram problem

Requirements:

1. The hill climber takes a cryptogram problem and gets an initial solution
  from it.
2. The hill climber will enter a loop where it will copy the current solution
  and creates a bunch of other solutions that are mutated. Then the best
  solution that is better or equal to the current solution now becomes the
  new current solution and loop continues to the next iteration.
3. If the algorithm finds a perfect solution, ie. the reported score equals
  the maximum possible end the loop and report the solution.
3. If the algorithm hasn't increased the solution's score after N iterations or
  we've hit4 a maximum iteration limit M, end the loop and the current solution
  becomes the reported solution.
4. Alternatively, if we end without finding a perfect solution rerun the loop
  with a new initial solution X times, and report the best solution out of all
  solutions reported by the individual loops.
